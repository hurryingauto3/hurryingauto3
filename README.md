## **What I Do**

I build **scalable software systems** at the intersection of **AI, infrastructure, and product**—from distributed training pipelines to production APIs serving hundreds of thousands of users.

**Core Strengths:**
- **Backend Engineering** → High-throughput APIs, microservices, database optimization
- **AI/ML Systems** → Model training, serving, monitoring, and deployment at scale
- **Cloud Infrastructure** → Kubernetes, CI/CD, observability, cost optimization
- **Full-Stack Development** → End-to-end product delivery with modern frameworks

**Currently:** MS Computer Engineering @ NYU (Graduating May 2026) | SWE @ Trinity Life Sciences


**Previously:** Built production systems at BlueLake (500K MAU)
